# Drone with computer vision on Jetson-NX(ARMv8)
* This project focuses on low power management and integrating flight system with image recognition system.
* Using DVFS on CPU and GPU, and even exploring relationship with DVFS and drone-attitude control frequency.
## computer vision using `detectNet` of `jetson-inference`
* [jetson-inference](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference)
## control algorithm:
* [PID control](https://github.com/a0983511138/Jetson-NX_drone_controller)
## sensor:
* [NMEA-GPS](https://github.com/craigpeacock/NMEA-GPS)
* Gyro
* Webcam
* Pca9685
* Arduino_ADC(to monitor bat_life)
